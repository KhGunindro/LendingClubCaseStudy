    "### Problem statement:\n",
    "A consumer finance company specialized in lending various types of loans to urban customers. \n",
    "The goal is to identify factors indicating whether a person is likely to default on a loan based on the previous customer datas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach: \n",
    "In addressing the challenge of identifying key factors driving loan default, we'll adopt a systematic approach to pinpoint potential drivers and understand their impact. This is a predictive exploratory analysis focused on determining the variables influencing loan default rather than projecting future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding:\n",
    "We have been given complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011."
