# Project Description: Loan Default Prediction using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Problem Statement
In this project, we aim to utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to address the challenge of loan default prediction. By analyzing historical loan data, we seek to identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a loan applicant is likely to default. This understanding will enable us to take appropriate actions, such as denying loans, adjusting loan amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates, to mitigate the risk of financial loss for the lending company.

## Data Understanding
The dataset provided contains comprehensive loan data spanning from 2007 to 2011, encompassing information about past loan applicants and their loan repayment outcomes. This dataset serves as the foundation for our EDA and loan default prediction analysis.


## Project Tasks:
1. **Data Collection**: Download the loan dataset provided.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of data.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct thorough EDA to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights related to loan default.

## Conclusions

Factors Influencing Loan Default:

- Loan Amount: Loans exceeding $15,000 tend to exhibit a higher default rate.
- Funded Amount Invested: Similarly, investments exceeding $15,000 are associated with a higher default rate.
- Interest Rate: The default rate tends to increase with higher interest rates.
- Annual Income: Applicants with higher annual incomes are less likely to default on their loans.
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): An increase in DTI is correlated with a higher default rate.
- Loan Term: Longer loan terms (e.g., 60 months) have a higher default rate compared to shorter terms (e.g., 36 months).
- Loan Grade and Subgrade: Lower loan grades and subgrades are associated with higher default rates.
- Verification Status: Interestingly, verified applicants exhibit a higher default rate.
- Small Business Borrowers: Small business borrowers are more prone to defaulting on their loans.
